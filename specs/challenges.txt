Challenges to solve

   -The project owner wanted a tailor made shopping cart. he did not want to 
   use pre made packages. One of his requirements was that both guest and registered 
   users would be able to use their mobile number and not just email 
   to order food. To solve the problem, I configured the Laravel application to be able to connect
   to a text message API system so that when users order something or wanted to reset their password
   they would be able to receive notifications on their phone as well as email. 

   -One of the requirements of the project owner was a tailor made and easy to use
   admin account page. he used to use a WordPress admin page and he said it was too complicated for him.
   For solving this problem, I sat down with him
   and managed to extract his exact expectations of admin functionalities translated
   those requirements into an easy to use admin page that does not have any extra and confusing
   functionalities. and at the same time satisfies all his expectations such as adding or removing 
   a new menu item. or setting online shop on or off.
